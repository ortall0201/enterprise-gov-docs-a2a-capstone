# VaaS: Vendor-as-a-Service for Secure Enterprise AI

## Problem Statement: The $100K Compliance Wall

As a team of developers, we built a document translation service using CrewAI. When we approached enterprises and government agencies, we hit an insurmountable barrier:

**"Do you have SOC 2 Type II certification? GDPR compliance documentation? Liability insurance for PII exposure?"**

The answer was no. These certifications cost $100K+ and take 12+ months. **We couldn't afford to sell our AI service to the customers who needed it most.**

Then, during Day 5 of this course, we had a breakthrough: **What if the customer never sends us their PII in the first place?**

---

## Why Agents? The Day 5 Breakthrough

### The Learning Journey

**Days 1-4:** We built the foundation. Day 1 taught us multi-agent orchestration—we created `IntakeAgent` and `ProcessingAgent` using sequential workflow patterns. Day 2 showed us how to build custom function tools for OCR extraction and PII filtering, plus the `BuiltInCodeExecutor` pattern. Day 3 introduced `DatabaseSessionService` for persistent workflows and context compaction for handling large document histories. Day 4 taught observability—`LoggingPlugin` for standard traces and custom callbacks for security audit trails.

**Day 5: The "Aha!" Moment**

Then came the A2A (Agent2Agent) protocol lesson. The product catalog example showed:

```
Customer Support Agent → A2A → Product Catalog Agent (External Vendor)
```

The customer's internal agent called an external vendor via A2A. **The vendor never accessed the customer's systems. The customer controlled what data crossed the boundary.**

**That's when it clicked:**

**Traditional SaaS:** Customer → Sends Raw PII → Vendor Processes → Vendor Liable

**VaaS with A2A:** Customer's Agent → Filters PII → A2A → Vendor's Agent → Vendor Never Sees Raw PII

The customer deploys `RemoteA2aAgent` (their code, their responsibility). They filter PII before calling our service. **We're tool providers, not data processors.** Clear liability boundary.

This changes everything. We can sell to enterprises **without $100K in compliance costs** because:
- Customer deploys their own RemoteA2aAgent
- They filter PII pre-vendor
- We only provide translation capabilities
- No direct PII access = simplified compliance

## What We Created: Two-Sided VaaS Architecture

### Enterprise System (Customer Side)

**Multi-Agent Sequential Pipeline:**
```
IntakeAgent (validates document)
    ↓
ProcessingAgent (5-step pipeline)
    ├─ OCR Tool (extracts text)
    ├─ Security Filter (masks 7 PII patterns)
    ├─ RemoteA2aAgent (A2A boundary crossing)
    ├─ Security Verification (checks response)
    └─ Final Compilation
```

**Key Components with Course Concepts:**

**1. IntakeAgent** (Day 1: Basic agent with tools)
- Custom tool: `validate_document()` checks file integrity
- Generates document ID stored in session state (Day 3)

**2. ProcessingAgent** (Day 1: Sequential workflow + Day 5: A2A integration)
```python
processing_agent = LlmAgent(
    model=Gemini(model="gemini-2.0-flash-lite"),
    tools=[ocr_tool, security_filter],
    sub_agents=[remote_vendor_agent],  # Day 5: A2A boundary!
    output_key="processing_result"
)
```
Uses Day 1's `output_key` pattern to pass state between steps.

**3. Security Layer** (Day 2: Custom tool with deterministic regex)
```python
PII_PATTERNS = {
    "national_id_spain": r"\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}-[A-Z]\b",
    "ssn": r"\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b",
    "phone": r"\b(\+?\d{1,3}[-.\s]?)...",
    "email": r"\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@...",
    "credit_card": r"\b\d{4}[-\s]?...",
    "date_of_birth": r"\b\d{1,2}\s+de\s+\w+,?\s+\d{4}\b",
    "passport": r"\b[A-Z]{3}-\d{9}\b"
}
```
**Why regex over LLM?** Day 4's observability lesson taught us: deterministic tools are debuggable. We can log exact matches, write unit tests, and pass compliance audits.

**4. Session Management** (Day 3)
- `DatabaseSessionService` with SQLite for workflow persistence
- `EventsCompactionConfig` handles long document histories
- Session state tracks document IDs through pipeline

**5. Observability** (Day 4)
```python
# Standard traces
plugins=[LoggingPlugin()]

# Custom security audit
class SecurityAuditPlugin(BasePlugin):
    async def after_tool_callback(self, callback_context):
        if callback_context.tool_name == "security_filter":
            self.log_pii_event(callback_context.tool_result)
```

### Vendor System (Our Docs Translator Service)

**Day 5: Agent Exposed via A2A**
```python
from adk.a2a import to_a2a

vendor_agent = LlmAgent(
    model=Gemini(model="gemini-2.0-flash-lite"),
    tools=[translate_document, validate_translation]
)

# Expose via A2A protocol
a2a_app = to_a2a(vendor_agent, port=8001)
uvicorn.run(a2a_app, host="localhost", port=8001)

# Serves:
# - Agent Card: /.well-known/agent-card.json
# - Streaming: /streams
```

**Customer Connects via RemoteA2aAgent:**
```python
remote_vendor = RemoteA2aAgent(
    name="docs_translator_vendor",
    agent_card="http://localhost:8001/.well-known/agent-card.json"
)

processing_agent = LlmAgent(
    sub_agents=[remote_vendor]  # Cross-org boundary!
)
```

## Demo: Spanish Birth Certificate Translation

**Input Document:**
```
CERTIFICADO DE NACIMIENTO
DNI: 123-45-6789-X
Fecha: 15 de marzo, 1990
Email: maria.garcia@ejemplo.es
```

**Execution Flow:**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start vendor A2A service
python -m vendor.vendor_server

# Terminal 2: Run customer pipeline
python main.py
```

**What Happens (with Day 4 observability logs):**

```
[IntakeAgent] Document validated: doc_1234567890

[ProcessingAgent] Sequential pipeline:
1. [OCR] Extracted 247 characters
2. [Security Filter - PRE] Masking PII...
   ✓ DNI: 123-45-6789-X → ***-**-****-X
   ✓ Email: maria.garcia@ejemplo.es → m*************@ejemplo.es
   ✓ Date: 15 de marzo, 1990 → XX de XXXX, 1990

3. [RemoteA2aAgent] A2A call...
   → Agent card: http://localhost:8001/.well-known/agent-card.json
   → POST /streams with masked content
   ✓ Translation received (3.2s)

4. [Security Filter - POST] Verifying...
   → Risk score: 0.0 (SAFE)
   ✓ No PII leakage

5. [Compilation] Complete
```

**Vendor Never Saw:** Full national ID, complete email, exact birth date

**Why This Matters:** Government processes sensitive documents, vendor provides expertise, clear liability at A2A boundary.

---

## The Build: Technical Decisions

**Why Sequential over Parallel?** Each step depends on previous (can't translate before OCR, can't filter after vendor call).

**Why Custom Tools over MCP?** PII filtering requires deterministic behavior. MCP excellent for general integrations, but security-critical code needs unit tests.

**Why SQLite DatabaseSessionService?** Government document processing can't lose state on restart. InMemorySessionService would lose everything.

**Why A2A over REST API?**
1. Standardized (any A2A client works)
2. Self-documenting via Agent Card
3. Streaming support built-in
4. Future-proof as A2A ecosystem grows

**Course Concepts Applied:**
- ✅ Day 1: Sequential agents, multi-agent delegation, output_key
- ✅ Day 2: Custom function tools, AgentTool pattern, code execution
- ✅ Day 3: DatabaseSessionService, session state, context compaction
- ✅ Day 4: LoggingPlugin, custom callbacks, ADK web debugging
- ✅ Day 5: RemoteA2aAgent, to_a2a(), Agent Card, cross-org boundaries

## Business Innovation: VaaS Economics

**Traditional SaaS vs VaaS:**

| Cost | Traditional SaaS | VaaS with A2A |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| SOC 2 Certification | $100K+ | Not required* |
| GDPR Compliance | Legal team + DPO | Simplified** |
| Liability Insurance | $50K/year | Much lower*** |
| Time to Enterprise | 12+ months | Weeks |

*Vendor doesn't process PII, so data processor requirements don't apply
**Customer is data controller, vendor is tool provider
***Clear liability boundary at A2A protocol layer

**For small teams and startups, this is game-changing.**

---

## If We Had More Time

**Short-term:** Multi-language support (French, German, Arabic), Vertex AI Agent Engine deployment (Day 5b), Memory Bank integration for translation preferences.

**Mid-term:** Multiple document types (passports, medical records), customer dashboard, cryptographic signatures for filtered content.

**Long-term:** VaaS Marketplace where AI vendors expose capabilities via A2A, auto-compliance documentation generator, open-source `vaas-client` toolkit.

**Our Vision:** Every AI startup becomes a VaaS provider. Instead of $100K compliance costs blocking small teams from enterprise sales, A2A protocol democratizes enterprise AI.

---

## Conclusion: From Learning to Innovation

**Before this course:** Good AI service, couldn't sell to enterprises.

**After Day 5:** We realized the solution isn't certifications—it's architecture that doesn't need them.

**The progression:**
1. Day 1: Build agents that work
2. Day 2: Give them tools
3. Day 3: Make them remember
4. Day 4: Make them observable
5. Day 5: **Make them cross boundaries**

That last step unlocked VaaS. A2A isn't just about calling external agents—**it's about creating a liability boundary that makes enterprise AI accessible to small vendors.**

**VaaS is a new business model** where small AI vendors provide specialized capabilities via A2A, customers deploy RemoteA2aAgent clients, and clear separation of concerns enables both to thrive.
